# xcoinforum
This is the repository for documentation and configuration of the (coming) xcoinproject forum.

The goal is to make anyone with the knowledge required able to reconstruct the forum if needed.

When everything is ready for the public, you should find the link to the forum from the official website, http://www.xcoinproject.com, under "Community".
